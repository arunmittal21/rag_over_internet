Apple has released a new short film "Big Man" shot on an iPhone 16 Pro as part of its "Shot on iPhone" campaign. The company is also offering a new 90-minute session called "Direct Your Own Friendship Film on iPad" as part of its Today at Apple initiative, aimed at children aged up to 10. Additionally, Apple has refurbished Apple Watch Series 10 models available with a one-year limited warranty.

The iPhone 17 series is expected to launch in September 2025, with rumored features and improvements. Apple's iPhone development roadmap runs several years into the future, with the company continually working with suppliers on successive iPhone models.

Apple One, a subscription providing access to Apple's premium online services, is still worth considering in 2025, offering good value with advancements in Apple Music and Apple TV+ content. The Individual plan costs $19.95 per month, providing access to Apple TV+, Apple Music, Apple Arcade, and 50GB of iCloud+.

Other updates include the availability of the M4 MacBook Air for $829, and the upcoming release of macOS Tahoe and M4 Mac Pro in mid-late 2025.

Here is the raw content from the search results:\\nGoogle\'s revenue\\ngrowth in recent years has been significantly boosted by its cloud business, which has shown strong momentum with a 64% increase in sales between 2022 and 2024. The company\'s core search business is also performing well, driven by higher advertising revenues, a trend expected to continue. Notably, Google\'s search ad revenues are up 22%, while YouTube ad revenue has increased by 24% over the same period.\\nArtificial intelligence has emerged as a crucial growth driver across Google\\u2019s services; for instance, AI-powered features like AI Overviews and Circle to Search have enhanced user engagement in Search, and Google\\u2019s AI-powered Cloud portfolio has seen increased customer demand. This period highlights Google\\u2019s success in diversifying its revenue streams while maintaining its dominance in advertising, with cloud services and AI integration being the primary drivers of accelerated growth. An example of this diversification and growth is Waymo, Google\\u2019s autonomous driving subsidiary, which is now providing over 250,000 paid rides per week across Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Austin.

Google\\u2019s strategic AI investments are set to significantly expand its business. Google Cloud will benefit from increased enterprise demand for AI, boosting infrastructure and platform sales. Concurrently, AI will enhance Search and advertising through improved relevance and targeting, leading to greater user engagement, higher ad click-through rates, and better advertiser ROI. Additionally, AI-powered features in YouTube and other services are expected to drive user retention and premium subscription growth.\\nBut There Are Risks\\nMSN\\nMSN\\nMSN\\nMSN\\nMSN\\nMSN\\nMSN\\nMSN\\nMSN\\nSince 2022, Google\\u2019s operating margin has expanded by 600 basis points, rising from 26.5% to 32.7%. This improvement is a direct result of several key factors: the maturation and increasing profitability of Google Cloud, the continued strength and AI-enhanced monetization of its core advertising business, and a concerted effort to manage costs and improve operational efficiency across the entire company.\\nThis improved profitability, combined with strong sales growth and the rising demand for cloud infrastructure amid the AI boom, has positively shifted investor perception. Consequently, the company\\u2019s price-to-sales (P/S) valuation multiple has grown by 47%, climbing from 4.1x trailing revenues in 2022 to the current 6.1x.\\nBut What Next? Is GOOG Stock A Buy At $180?\\nAt its current trading price of around $180, GOOG stock\\u2019s price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 6.1x is closely aligned with its five-year average of 6.2x.

Additionally, there\\u2019s the regulatory risk, with the Department of Justice actively pushing for Google to be split to address alleged monopolistic practices in the search market.

This contrasted with a milder peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500 during the same period. While the stock fully recovered to its pre-crisis peak by January 25, 2024, a similar pattern emerged earlier this year amid trade war anxieties, where the stock dropped around 30% compared to a 19% peak-to-trough decline for the S&P 500.

Here is the raw content from the search results:\\nGoogle\'s revenue\\ngrowth in recent years has been significantly boosted by its cloud business, which has shown strong momentum with a 64% increase in sales between 2022 and 2024. The company\'s core search business is also performing well, driven by higher advertising revenues, a trend expected to continue. Notably, Google\'s search ad revenues are up 22%, while YouTube ad revenue has increased by 24% over the same period.\\nArtificial intelligence has emerged as a crucial growth driver across Google\\u2019s services; for instance, AI-powered features like AI Overviews and Circle to Search have enhanced user engagement in Search, and Google\\u2019s AI-powered Cloud portfolio has seen increased customer demand. This period highlights Google\\u2019s success in diversifying its revenue streams while maintaining its dominance in advertising, with cloud services and AI integration being the primary drivers of accelerated growth. An example of this diversification and growth is Waymo, Google\\u2019s autonomous driving subsidiary, which is now providing over 250,000 paid rides per week across Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Austin. See \\u2013\\nWhile Tesla Talks, Waymo Drives\\n.\\nMORE FOR YOU\\nWhat\\u2019s Driving The Valuation Higher For GOOG Stock?\\nGoogle\\u2019s Valuation Ratios\\nfor more details.\\nHowever, there are compelling reasons to believe this valuation multiple could climb higher. Google\\u2019s strategic AI investments are set to significantly expand its business. Google Cloud will benefit from increased enterprise demand for AI, boosting infrastructure and platform sales. Concurrently, AI will enhance Search and advertising through improved relevance and targeting, leading to greater user engagement, higher ad click-through rates, and better advertiser ROI. Additionally, AI-powered features in YouTube and other services are expected to drive user retention and premium subscription growth.\\nBut There Are Risks\\nMSN\\nMSN\\nMSN\\nMSN\\nMSN\\nMSN\\nMSN\\nMSN\\nMSN\\nSince 2022, Google\\u2019s operating margin has expanded by 600 basis points, rising from 26.5% to 32.7%. This improvement is a direct result of several key factors: the maturation and increasing profitability of Google Cloud, the continued strength and AI-enhanced monetization of its core advertising business, and a concerted effort to manage costs and improve operational efficiency across the entire company.\\nThis improved profitability, combined with strong sales growth and the rising demand for cloud infrastructure amid the AI boom, has positively shifted investor perception. Consequently, the company\\u2019s price-to-sales (P/S) valuation multiple has grown by 47%, climbing from 4.1x trailing revenues in 2022 to the current 6.1x.\\nBut What Next?

Since 2022, Google has invested an astonishing $134 billion in CapEx. A critical question looms: what if these considerable investments fail to deliver the anticipated returns? Additionally, there\\u2019s the regulatory risk, with the Department of Justice actively pushing for Google to be split to address alleged monopolistic practices in the search market.

This contrasted with a milder peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500 during the same period. While the stock fully recovered to its pre-crisis peak by January 25, 2024, a similar pattern emerged earlier this year amid trade war anxieties, where the stock dropped around 30% compared to a 19% peak-to-trough decline for the S&P 500.

This period highlights Google\\u2019s success in diversifying its revenue streams while maintaining its dominance in advertising, with cloud services and AI integration being the primary drivers of accelerated growth. An example of this diversification and growth is Waymo, Google\\u2019s autonomous driving subsidiary, which is now providing over 250,000 paid rides per week across Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Austin.

Concurrently, AI will enhance Search and advertising through improved relevance and targeting, leading to greater user engagement, higher ad click-through rates, and better advertiser ROI.

This improvement is a direct result of several key factors: the maturation and increasing profitability of Google Cloud, the continued strength and AI-enhanced monetization of its core advertising business, and a concerted effort to manage costs and improve operational efficiency across the entire company.\\nThis improved profitability, combined with strong sales growth and the rising demand for cloud infrastructure amid the AI boom, has positively shifted investor perception. Consequently, the company\\u2019s price-to-sales (P/S) valuation multiple has grown by 47%, climbing from 4.1x trailing revenues in 2022 to the current 6.1x.\\nBut What Next?

The company\'s core search business is also performing well, driven by higher advertising revenues, a trend expected to continue. Notably, Google\'s search ad revenues are up 22%, while YouTube ad revenue has increased by 24% over the same period.\\nArtificial intelligence has emerged as a crucial growth driver across Google\\u2019s services; for instance, AI-powered features like AI Overviews and Circle to Search have enhanced user engagement in Search, and Google\\u2019s AI-powered Cloud portfolio has seen increased customer demand. This period highlights Google\\u2019s success in diversifying its revenue streams while maintaining its dominance in advertising, with cloud services and AI integration being the primary drivers of accelerated growth. An example of this diversification and growth is Waymo, Google\\u2019s autonomous driving subsidiary, which is now providing over 250,000 paid rides per week across Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Austin.

Google\\u2019s strategic AI investments are set to significantly expand its business. Google Cloud will benefit from increased enterprise demand for AI, boosting infrastructure and platform sales. Concurrently, AI will enhance Search and advertising through improved relevance and targeting, leading to greater user engagement, higher ad click-through rates, and better advertiser ROI.

This improvement is a direct result of several key factors: the maturation and increasing profitability of Google Cloud, the continued strength and AI-enhanced monetization of its core advertising business, and a concerted effort to manage costs and improve operational efficiency across the entire company.\\nThis improved profitability, combined with strong sales growth and the rising demand for cloud infrastructure amid the AI boom, has positively shifted investor perception. Consequently, the company\\u2019s price-to-sales (P/S) valuation multiple has grown by 47%, climbing from 4.1x trailing revenues in 2022 to the current 6.1x.\\nBut What Next?

Google's revenue growth has been significantly boosted by its cloud business, which has shown strong momentum with a 64% increase in sales between 2022 and 2024. The company's core search business is also performing well, driven by higher advertising revenues. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a crucial growth driver across Google's services, enhancing user engagement and driving revenue growth. Google's strategic AI investments are expected to expand its business, with benefits in cloud infrastructure, search, and advertising. The company's operating margin has expanded by 600 basis points since 2022, rising from 26.5% to 32.7%. As a result, Google's price-to-sales (P/S) valuation multiple has grown by 47%, climbing from 4.1x to 6.1x. However, there are risks associated with Google's substantial capital expenditures and regulatory challenges. Despite these risks, Google's stock has seen impressive gains, and its valuation multiple could climb higher.

The research notes primarily provide a summary of Google's history, products, and services, as well as some general information about its financial performance and market share. However, the information is not specific to 2024 and does not provide a comprehensive answer to the original query.

The only relevant information that can be gleaned from the research notes is that Google's cloud business has shown strong momentum with a 64% increase in sales between 2022 and 2024, and that artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a crucial growth driver across Google's services. However, this information is not sufficient to provide a complete answer to the original query.

Therefore, I must state that the information is insufficient to provide a complete and final answer to the original query.

Here is the raw content from the search results:\\nGoogle\'s revenue\\ngrowth in recent years has been significantly boosted by its cloud business, which has shown strong momentum with a 64% increase in sales between 2022 and 2024. The company\'s core search business is also performing well, driven by higher advertising revenues, a trend expected to continue. Notably, Google\'s search ad revenues are up 22%, while YouTube ad revenue has increased by 24% over the same period.\\nArtificial intelligence has emerged as a crucial growth driver across Google\\u2019s services; for instance, AI-powered features like AI Overviews and Circle to Search have enhanced user engagement in Search, and Google\\u2019s AI-powered Cloud portfolio has seen increased customer demand. This period highlights Google\\u2019s success in diversifying its revenue streams while maintaining its dominance in advertising, with cloud services and AI integration being the primary drivers of accelerated growth. An example of this diversification and growth is Waymo, Google\\u2019s autonomous driving subsidiary, which is now providing over 250,000 paid rides per week across Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Austin.

Google\\u2019s strategic AI investments are set to significantly expand its business. Google Cloud will benefit from increased enterprise demand for AI, boosting infrastructure and platform sales. Concurrently, AI will enhance Search and advertising through improved relevance and targeting, leading to greater user engagement, higher ad click-through rates, and better advertiser ROI. Additionally, AI-powered features in YouTube and other services are expected to drive user retention and premium subscription growth.\\nBut There Are Risks\\nMSN\\nMSN\\nMSN\\nMSN\\nMSN\\nMSN\\nMSN\\nMSN\\nMSN\\nMSN\\nSince 2022, Google\\u2019s operating margin has expanded by 600 basis points, rising from 26.5% to 32.7%. This improvement is a direct result of several key factors: the maturation and increasing profitability of Google Cloud, the continued strength and AI-enhanced monetization of its core advertising business, and a concerted effort to manage costs and improve operational efficiency across the entire company.\\nThis improved profitability, combined with strong sales growth and the rising demand for cloud infrastructure amid the AI boom, has positively shifted investor perception. Consequently, the company\\u2019s price-to-sales (P/S) valuation multiple has grown by 47%, climbing from 4.1x trailing revenues in 2022 to the current 6.1x.\\nBut What Next?

This contrasted with a milder peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500 during the same period.

Here is the raw content from the search results:\\nGoogle\'s revenue\\ngrowth in recent years has been significantly boosted by its cloud business, which has shown strong momentum with a 64% increase in sales between 2022 and 2024. The company\'s core search business is also performing well, driven by higher advertising revenues, a trend expected to continue. Notably, Google\'s search ad revenues are up 22%, while YouTube ad revenue has increased by 24% over the same period.\\nArtificial intelligence has emerged as a crucial growth driver across Google\\u2019s services; for instance, AI-powered features like AI Overviews and Circle to Search have enhanced user engagement in Search, and Google\\u2019s AI-powered Cloud portfolio has seen increased customer demand. This period highlights Google\\u2019s success in diversifying its revenue streams while maintaining its dominance in advertising, with cloud services and AI integration being the primary drivers of accelerated growth. An example of this diversification and growth is Waymo, Google\\u2019s autonomous driving subsidiary, which is now providing over 250,000 paid rides per week across Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Austin. See \\u2013\\nWhile Tesla Talks, Waymo Drives\\n.\\nMORE FOR YOU\\nWhat\\u2019s Driving The Valuation Higher For GOOG Stock?\\nGoogle\\u2019s Valuation Ratios\\nfor more details.\\nHowever, there are compelling reasons to believe this valuation multiple could climb higher. Google\\u2019s strategic AI investments are set to significantly expand its business. Google Cloud will benefit from increased enterprise demand for AI, boosting infrastructure and platform sales. Concurrently, AI will enhance Search and advertising through improved relevance and targeting, leading to greater user engagement, higher ad click-through rates, and better advertiser ROI. Additionally, AI-powered features in YouTube and other services are expected to drive user retention and premium subscription growth.\\nBut There Are Risks\\nMSN\\nMSN\\nMSN\\nMSN\\nMSN\\nMSN\\nMSN\\nMSN\\nMSN\\nMSN\\nSince 2022, Google\\u2019s operating margin has expanded by 600 basis points, rising from 26.5% to 32.7%. This improvement is a direct result of several key factors: the maturation and increasing profitability of Google Cloud, the continued strength and AI-enhanced monetization of its core advertising business, and a concerted effort to manage costs and improve operational efficiency across the entire company.\\nThis improved profitability, combined with strong sales growth and the rising demand for cloud infrastructure amid the AI boom, has positively shifted investor perception. Consequently, the company\\u2019s price-to-sales (P/S) valuation multiple has grown by 47%, climbing from 4.1x trailing revenues in 2022 to the current 6.1x.\\nBut What Next? Is GOOG Stock A Buy At $180?\\nAt its current trading price of around $180, GOOG stock\\u2019s price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 6.1x is closely aligned with its five-year average of 6.2x.

Since 2022, Google has invested an astonishing $134 billion in CapEx. A critical question looms: what if these considerable investments fail to deliver the anticipated returns? Additionally, there\\u2019s the regulatory risk, with the Department of Justice actively pushing for Google to be split to address alleged monopolistic practices in the search market.

This contrasted with a milder peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500 during the same period.

Google's revenue growth has been significantly boosted by its cloud business, which has shown strong momentum with a 64% increase in sales between 2022 and 2024. The company's core search business is also performing well, driven by higher advertising revenues. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a crucial growth driver across Google's services, enhancing user engagement and driving revenue growth. Google's strategic AI investments are expected to expand its business, with benefits in cloud infrastructure, search, and advertising. The company's operating margin has expanded by 600 basis points since 2022, rising from 26.5% to 32.7%. As a result, Google's price-to-sales (P/S) valuation multiple has grown by 47%, climbing from 4.1x to 6.1x. However, there are risks associated with Google's substantial capital expenditures and regulatory challenges. Despite these risks, Google's stock has seen impressive gains, and its valuation multiple could climb higher.

Google has announced several updates, including iOS 26, macOS Tahoe, M4 Mac Pro, and iPhone 17, with features like Liquid Glass redesign, Phone app, and revamped Spotlight. Additionally, Google has introduced Gemini 2.5, an AI platform with "thinking" capabilities, which allows models to process problems more deliberately before responding. This platform is targeted at enterprise buyers, with a new pricing strategy that includes a bottom tier designed to capture price-sensitive workloads. Google has also launched Search Live, a real-time voice search feature in AI Mode, which allows users to have natural conversations with Search while receiving web links in real-time. The feature uses a custom version of Gemini with advanced voice features and remembers previous conversations, enabling users to ask follow-up questions naturally.
